Game controls, displays, and player interaction connected with an ESP32 MCU in an IoT manner. I worked on this project with Vivian Wong and Mei Hao for the ME218: Smart Product Design course series at Stanford. This project was heavily focused on inter-processor communication and protocols. You can find more detailed documentation on the hardware and software on our [project report website](https://team6triac.weebly.com).

The game was a battle royale between teams of three on a virtual Linear Region. Each team forms a spaceship comprised of three physical stations that control navigation, weapons and power distribution. The stations use the internet to communicate with each other and enemy ships through a TCP/IP link. An ESP32 Internet communications module was used to facillitate the communication and implemented an XBee-style commmunication over the TCP/IP link.

Each team's ship consisted of three stations that communicate together to act as one.

* OPAMP: The OPAMP station allocates power to the navigation, weapons and shields systems.
* TVS: The TVS station controls the weapons systems. It gets power information from the OPAMP and controls firing.
* ZENER:  The ZENER station works as the navigation unit, controlling and broadcasting location to other teams.

The Linear Region is the virtual playing field for our battleships. Two axes, x and y, are defined as shown. The x axis has a length of 512,000km and the y axis a length of 256,000km. The largest value x can have is an infinitesimally small amount below 512,000, and the largest value y can have is an infinitesimally small amount below 256,000. The moment x reaches 512,000, it wraps around (or ”overflows”) to 0, and likewise the moment y reaches 256,000, it wraps around to 0. This is exactly equivalent to playing on the toroidal space pictured at left.
