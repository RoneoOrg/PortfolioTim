Game controls, displays, and player interaction connected with an ESP32 MCU in an IoT manner. I worked on this project with Vivian Wong and Mei Hao for the ME218: Smart Product Design course series at Stanford. This project was heavily focused on inter-processor communication and protocols. You can find more detailed documentation on the hardware and software on our [project report website](https://team6triac.weebly.com).

The game was a battle royale between teams of three on a virtual Linear Region. Each team forms a spaceship comprised of three physical stations that control navigation, weapons and power distribution. The stations use the internet to communicate with each other and enemy ships through a TCP/IP link. An ESP32 Internet communications module was used to facillitate the communication and implemented an XBee-style commmunication over the TCP/IP link.
