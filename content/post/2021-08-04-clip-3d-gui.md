Alongside my coursework I've been working as a research assistant for the DeSimone Research Group at Stanford since January 2021. I've been responsible for developing print controls software and the embedded system that drives the advanced CLIP 3D printers we are constructing. The software is now running on three of our in-house developed printers which are being used to conduct research on high-resolution and high-speed 3D printing, development of biodegradable materials, and microneedles for vaccine deployment. Due to the sensitive nature of research pre-publishing some details are withheld and will be released once the relevant papers are published.

CLIP3DGUI is coded in C++ with the Qt framework for GUI implementation. Codacy's automatic code review and static code analysis tools are used alongside with Clang-Tidy and Clazy to improve code quality. Sphinx, Read The Docs, Breathe, and Doxygen are used in combination to create the documentation website: [clip3dgui.readthedocs.io](https://clip3dgui.readthedocs.io/). Jira Software is used for project management. The project is open soure, licensed under GPLv3 and integrates the following open source libraries:
* Serialib: RS232 serial communication library
* HIDAPI: USB HID communication library 
* QCustomPlot: plotting tool for Qt widgets
* OpenCV: image processing toolbox

Above all else CLIP3DGUI is designed to act as a research tool with a large amount of tunable parameters. The user should be able to customize every aspect of the print process to achieve the best results for their prints.
