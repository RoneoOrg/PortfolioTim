For detailed documentation on the CLIP3DGUI project take at our ReadTheDocs website: 
[clip3dgui.readthedocs.io](https://clip3dgui.readthedocs.io/)

CLIP3DGUI is open source and the project repo can be found on github:

Alongside my coursework I've been working as a research assistant for the DeSimone Research Group at Stanford since January 2021. I've been responsible for developing print controls software and the embedded system that drives the advanced CLIP 3D printers we are constructing. The software is now running on three of our in-house developed printers which are being used to conduct research on
high-resolution and high-speed 3D printing, development of biodegradable materials, and microneedles for vaccine deployment.

CLIP3DGUI is coded in C++ with the Qt framework for GUI implementation. The project is open soure (GPLv3) and integrates the following
open source libraries:

* Serialib: RS232 serial communication library
* HIDAPI: USB HID communication library 
* QCustomPlot: plotting tool for Qt widgets
* OpenCV: image processing toolbox

Above all else CLIP3DGUI is designed to act as a research tool with a large amount of tunable parameters. The user should be able to customize every aspect of the print process to achieve the best results for their prints.
