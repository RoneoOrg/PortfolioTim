Using the open source Robot Operating System (ROS) software platform our group programmed a robot to explore a map, detect objects in the map, 
and perform a rescue mission on a subset of the objects. We implemented our own A\* path planning algorithm with path smoothing, closed loop trajectory, 
and pose controllers for accurate execution of the planned path. A pretrained CNN was integrated for objects detection and classification. 
Designed and implemented a Finite State Machine (FSM) to govern robot operation. This project was completed with Andrew Low, Abhishek Raghunathan, and Kathy Huangy 
for CS237: Principles of Robot Autonomy at Stanford.
