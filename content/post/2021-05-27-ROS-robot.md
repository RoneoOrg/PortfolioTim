Using the open source Robot Operating System (ROS) software platform our group programmed a robot to perform a rescuse mission. First our robot was placed in an unknown world with a set of objects and it was tasked with exploring the world and generating a map while detecting and recording the objects positions along the way. For the second part of the rescue mission our robot was tasked with rescuing a subset of the objects. We implemented our own A\* path planning algorithm along with path smoothing, closed loop control, 
and pose controllers for accurate execution of the planned path. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) was used to create a 2-D occupancy grid map from lidar and pose data from the robot. A pretrained CNN was integrated for objects detection and classification. 
We designed and implemented a Finite State Machine (FSM) to govern robot operation. This project was completed with Andrew Low, Abhishek Raghunathan, and Kathy Huang 
for CS237: Principles of Robot Autonomy at Stanford.

### Dynamics and Control

The robot is modelled as a differential drive nonholonomic wheeled robot. The nonholonomic constraint refers to the rolling without slipping condition for the wheels which leads to a non-integrable set of kinematic constraints. To make the trajectory generation more computationally efficient, differential flatness is applied to our model. This allows for the control problem to be solved linearly. Additionally a pose controller is applied as the robot near it's goal position, we implemented the method described in ["Closed Loop Steering of Unicycle-like Vehicles via Lyapunov Techniques"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=388294&tag=1) by M. Aicarda et al.

### Path Planning with A*
For path planning we implemented the A* label correcting algorithm, a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm with an applied heuristic to bias the search towards the goal.

### Motion Planning
To bridge the gap between the planned path and trackable trajectories for our differential drive we used kinodynamic motion planning to directly plan trajectories which meet our robot's kinematic and dynamics constraints. First, the trajectory is smoothed with a cubic spline, then the control inputs are scaled to feasible ranges, and finally our pose controller is applied to reach the goal position. 

### Mapping
For mapping our world we used the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) gmapping package in ROS ([slam_gmapping](https://wiki.ros.org/slam_gmapping)). The output 2-D occupancy grid is generated based on lidar data from the robot. Additionally, we applied map dilation to the 2-D occupancy grid to artificially inflate the size of obstacles to avoid collisions.
