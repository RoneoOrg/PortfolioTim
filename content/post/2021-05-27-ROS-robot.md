Game controls, displays, and player interaction connected with an ESP32 MCU in an IoT manner. I worked on this project with Vivian Wong and Mei Hao for the ME218: Smart Product Design course series at Stanford. This project was heavily focused on inter-processor communication and protocols. You can find more detailed documentation on the hardware and software on our [project report website](https://team6triac.weebly.com).
